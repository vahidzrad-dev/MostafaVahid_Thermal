	Abstract = {The flow behavior of lipid bilayer membranes is characterized by a surface viscosity for in-plane shear deformations, and an intermonolayer friction coefficient for slip between the two leaflets of the bilayer. Both properties have been studied for a variety of coarse-grained double-tailed model lipids, using equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. For lipids with two identical tails, the surface shear viscosity rises rapidly with tail length, while the intermonolayer friction coefficient is less sensitive to the tail length. Interdigitation of lipid tails across the bilayer midsurface, as observed for lipids with two distinct tails, strongly enhances the intermonolayer friction coefficient, but hardly affects the surface shear viscosity. The simulation results are compared against the available experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Research on giant vesicles is becoming increasingly popular. Giant vesicles provide model biomembrane systems for systematic measurements of mechanical and rheological properties of bilayers as a function of membrane composition and temperature, as well as hydrodynamic interactions. Membrane response to external factors ( for example electric fields, ions and amphiphilic molecules) can be directly visualized under the microscope. In this paper we review our current understanding of lipid bilayers as obtained from studies on giant unilamellar vesicles. Because research on giant vesicles increasingly attracts the interest of scientists from various backgrounds, we also try to provide a concise introduction for newcomers in the field. Finally, we summarize some recent developments on curvature effects induced by polymers, domain formation in membranes and shape transitions induced by electric fields.},

@article{Evans94CPL,
	Abstract = {In the past, mechanical models for lipid bilayers have been conceptualized on the basis that the membrane is a 'unit' structure where energy is coupled to deformation through single fields for surface curvature and density - valid only for chemically bonded layers. By comparison, real bilayers are composed of two weakly adherent monolayers that can move slowly past one another with negligible input of local energy if shape remains constant. However, when bilayer shape changes rapidly, an unexpected viscous impedance arises from relative motion between layers, which significantly augments conventional retardation by dissipation in hydrodynamic how. The added dissipation is produced by drag at the monolayer-monolayer interface. This leads to 'hidden dynamic coupling' of the layers through density differences that spread diffusively over the surface with long range consequences. Here, we examine the origins of mechanical coupling between layers in bilayers and show that evolution of the 
differential density between layers creates new dynamics previously overlooked in membrane behavior. To demonstrate the profound affect of dynamic coupling in bilayers, we describe a model situation (supported by experimental evidence) where a nanoscale tube of membrane is pulled rapidly from a macroscopic-size vesicle. Rapid extraction of bilayer through this 1000-fold increase in curvature creates an enormous relative motion between layers near the vesicle-tube junction (molecules in opposite layers slip past at rates approaching 10(5)/s) and, in rum, interlayer drag that dominates the extraction force.},

@article{Seifert97AP,
	Abstract = {Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions, vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate 
regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating an effective tension. For vesicles of non-spherical topology, the conformal invariance of the curvature energy leads to conformal diffusion, which signifies a one-fold degeneracy of the ground state. Unbinding and adhesion transitions arise from the balance between attractive interactions and entropic repulsion or a cost in bending energy, respectively. Both the dynamics of equilibrium fluctuations and the dynamics of shape transformations are governed not only by viscous damping in the surrounding liquid but also by internal friction if the two monolayers slip over each other. More complex membranes such as that of the red blood cell exhibit a variety of new phenomena because of coupling between internal degrees of freedom and external geometry.},

	Abstract = {We propose a mechanism by which changes of the mechanical tension of a composite lipid membrane are buffered by the invagination of membrane domains. We show that domain invagination, driven by differences in chemical composition, is a first-order transition controlled by membrane tension. The invaginated domains play the role of a membrane reservoir, exchanging area with the main membrane, and impose an equilibrium tension entirely controlled by their mechanical properties. The dynamical response of the reservoir reflects the tension-dependent kinetics of the domain shape transition, so that the tension of such a composite membrane is inherently transient and dynamical. The implications of this phenomenon for the mechanical properties of the membranes of living cells, where invaginated membrane domains are known to exist, are discussed.},

@article{Papadopulos2007Flippase,
	Abstract = {Transbilayer movement of phospholipids in biological membranes is mediated by energy-dependent and energy-independent flippases. Available methods for detection of flippase mediated transversal flip-flop are essentially based on spin-labeled or fluorescent lipid analogues. Here we demonstrate that shape change of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) can be used as a new tool to study the occurrence and time scale of flippase-mediated transbilayer movement of unlabeled phospholipids. Insertion of lipids into the external leaflet created an area difference between the two leaflets that caused the formation of a bud-like structure. Under conditions of negligible flip-flop, the bud was stable. Upon reconstitution of the energy-independent flippase activity of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum into GUVs, the initial bud formation was reversible, and the shapes were recovered. This can be ascribed to a rapid flip-flop leading to relaxation of the monolayer area difference. Theoretical analysis of kinetics 
of shape changes provides self-consistent determination of the flip-flop rate and further kinetic parameters. Based on that analysis, the half-time of phospholipid flip-flop in the presence of endoplasmic reticulum proteins was found to be on the order of few minutes. In contrast, GUVs reconstituted with influenza virus protein formed stable buds. The results argue for the presence of specific membrane proteins mediating rapid flip-flop.},

	Abstract = {Stimulation of the aminophospholipid translocase, responsible for the transport of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, provokes endocytic-like vesicles in erythrocytes and stimulates endocytosis in K562 cells. In this article arguments are given which support the idea that the active transport of lipids could be the driving force involved in membrane folding during the early step of endocytosis. The model is sustained by experiments on shape changes of pure lipid vesicles triggered by a change in the proportion of inner and outer lipids. It is shown that the formation of microvesicles with a diameter of 100-200 nm caused by the translocation of plasma membrane lipids implies a surface tension in the whole membrane. It is likely that cytoskeleton proteins and inner organelles prevent a real cell from undergoing overall shape changes of the type seen with giant unilamellar vesicles. Another hypothesis put forward in this 
article is the possible implication of the phospholipid 'scramblase' during exocytosis which could favor the unfolding of microvesicles. (C) 2000 Societe francaise de biochimie et biologie moleculaire / Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.},

@article{Devaux92,
	Abstract = {The influence of a phospholipid transmembrane redistribution on the shape of nonspherical flaccid vesicles was investigated at a fixed temperature by optical microscopy. In a first series of experiments, a transmembrane pH gradient was imposed on egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)-egg phosphatidylglycerol (EPG) (100:1) giant vesicles. The DELTA-pH induced an asymmetric distribution of EPG. Simultaneously, discoid vesicles were transformed into tubular or a series of connected small vesicles. The fraction of phospholipid transfer necessary for a shape change from discoid to two connected vesicles was of the order of 0.1\% of the total phospholipids. Additional lipid redistribution was accompanied by a sequence of shape changes. In a second series of experiments, lyso phosphatidylcholine (L-PC) was added to, or subtracted from, the external leaflet of giant EPC vesicles. The addition of L-PC induced a change from discoid to a two-vesicle state without further evolution, suggesting that lipid transfer 
and lipid addition are not equivalent. L-PC depletion from the outer leaflet generated stomatocyte-like vesicles. Whenever possible, we have determined whether the giant vesicles undergoing shape changes were unilamellar or multilamellar by measuring the elastic area compressibility modulus, K, by the micropipette assay (Kwok and Evans, 1981). Shape transformations triggered by phospholipid modification of the most external bilayer were indeed influenced by the presence of other underlying membranes that played a role comparable to that of a passive cytoskeleton layer. It appears that in real cells, invaginations of the plasma membrane or budding of organelles could be triggered by a phospholipid transfer from one leaflet to the other caused, for instance, by the aminophospholipid translocase which is present in eukaryotic membranes.},

	Abstract = {We present a microelectrofusion method for construction of fluid-state lipid bilayer networks of high geometrical complexity up to fully connected networks with genus = 3 topology. Within networks, self-organizing branching nanotube architectures could be produced where intersections spontaneously arrange themselves into three-way junctions with an angle of 120{degrees} between each nanotube. Formation of branching nanotube networks appears to follow a minimum-bending energy algorithm that solves for pathway minimization. It is also demonstrated that materials can be injected into specific containers within a network by nanotube-mediated transport of satellite vesicles having defined contents. Using a combination of microelectrofusion, spontaneous nanotube pattern formation, and satellite-vesicle injection, complex networks of containers and nanotubes can be produced for a range of applications in, for example, nanofluidics and artificial cell design. In addition, this electrofusion method 
allows integration of biological cells into lipid nanotube-vesicle networks.

Budding was induced by increasing the area-to-volume ratio through heating. Morphological changes were monitored by phase contrast microscopy and correlated with the thermal behavior of the bilayer by differential scanning calorimetry. Freeze fracture electron microscopy revealed that budding and fission are not restricted to giant vesicles but also occur on length scales relevant for cellular processes. We also observed osmotically induced budding and fission in mixtures of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine with cholesterol. We find that these shape transitions are driven by liquid/gel domain formation and/or coupling of the spontaneous curvature of the membrane to the local lipid composition. Our results provide evidence that coat proteins are not necessary for budding and fission of vesicles. The physics of the lipid bilayer is rich enough to explain the observed 
behavior.},

In this article arguments are given which support the idea that the active transport of lipids could be the driving force involved in membrane folding during the early step of endocytosis. The model is sustained by experiments on shape changes of pure lipid vesicles triggered by a change in the proportion of inner and outer lipids. It is shown that the formation of microvesicles with a diameter of 100-200 nm caused by the translocation of plasma membrane lipids implies a surface tension in the whole membrane. It is likely that cytoskeleton proteins and inner organelles prevent a real cell from undergoing overall shape changes of the type seen with giant unilamellar vesicles. Another hypothesis put forward in this 
article is the possible implication of the phospholipid 'scramblase' during exocytosis which could favor the unfolding of microvesicles. (C) 2000 Societe francaise de biochimie et biologie moleculaire / Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.},

@article{Farge92,
	Abstract = {The influence of a phospholipid transmembrane redistribution on the shape of nonspherical flaccid vesicles was investigated at a fixed temperature by optical microscopy. In a first series of experiments, a transmembrane pH gradient was imposed on egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)-egg phosphatidylglycerol (EPG) (100:1) giant vesicles. The DELTA-pH induced an asymmetric distribution of EPG. Simultaneously, discoid vesicles were transformed into tubular or a series of connected small vesicles. The fraction of phospholipid transfer necessary for a shape change from discoid to two connected vesicles was of the order of 0.1\% of the total phospholipids. Additional lipid redistribution was accompanied by a sequence of shape changes. In a second series of experiments, lyso phosphatidylcholine (L-PC) was added to, or subtracted from, the external leaflet of giant EPC vesicles. The addition of L-PC induced a change from discoid to a two-vesicle state without further evolution, suggesting that lipid transfer 
and lipid addition are not equivalent. L-PC depletion from the outer leaflet generated stomatocyte-like vesicles. Whenever possible, we have determined whether the giant vesicles undergoing shape changes were unilamellar or multilamellar by measuring the elastic area compressibility modulus, K, by the micropipette assay (Kwok and Evans, 1981). Shape transformations triggered by phospholipid modification of the most external bilayer were indeed influenced by the presence of other underlying membranes that played a role comparable to that of a passive cytoskeleton layer. It appears that in real cells, invaginations of the plasma membrane or budding of organelles could be triggered by a phospholipid transfer from one leaflet to the other caused, for instance, by the aminophospholipid translocase which is present in eukaryotic membranes.},

@article{Inaoka2007,
	Abstract = {Vesicle fissions are very important processes of biomembranes in cells, but their mechanisms are not clear and are controversial. Using the single giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) method, we recently found that low concentrations (less than the critical micelle concentration (CMC)) of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) induced the vesicle fission of GUVs of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol(6/4) (DPPC/chol(6/4)) membranes and sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes (6/4) in the liquid-ordered (lo) phase. In this report, to elucidate its mechanism, we have investigated the effect of low concentrations (much less than their CMC) of other amphiphiles with a single long hydrocarbon chain (i.e., single long chain amphiphiles) on DPPC/chol(6/4) GUVs as well as the effect of the membrane composition on the lyso-PC-induced vesicle fission. We found that low concentrations of single long chain amphiphiles (lyosophosphatidic acid, octylglucoside, and sodium dodecyl sulfate) induced the shape change 
from a prolate to two spheres connected by a very narrow neck, indicating that the single long chain amphiphiles can be partitioned into the external monolayer in the lo phase of the GUV from the aqueous solution. As the single long chain amphiphile concentrations were increased, all of them induced vesicle fission of DPPC/chol(6/4) GUVs above their threshold concentrations. To elucidate the role of cholesterol in the single long chain amphiphile-induced vesicle fission, we investigated the effect of lyso-PC on GUVs of dioleoyl-PC (DOPC)/chol(6/4) membranes in the L-alpha phase; no vesicle fission occurred, indicating that cholesterol in itself did not play an important role in the vesicle fission. Finally, to elucidate the effect of the inclusion of DOPC in the lo-phase membrane of GUVs on the lyso-PC-induced vesicle fission of the DPPC/chol(6/4) GUV, we investigated the effect of low concentrations of lyso-PC on GUVs of DPPC/DOPC/chol membranes. With an increase in DOPC concentration in the membrane, the 
threshold concentration of lyso-PC increased. At and above 30 mol \% DOPC, no vesicle fission occurred. On the basis of these results, we have proposed a hypothesis of the mechanism of the single long chain amphiphile-induced vesicle fission of a GUV of a lo-phase membrane.},

	Abstract = {Cellular processes involving membrane vesiculation are related to cellular transport and membrane components trafficking. Endocytosis, formation of caveolae and caveosomes, as well as Golgi membranes traffic have been linked to the existence and dynamics of particular types of lipid/protein membrane domains, enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, called rafts [Nature 387 (1997) 569-, Trends Cell Biol. 12 (2002) 296; Biochemistry 27 (1988) 6197]. In addition, the participation of phospholipases in the vesiculation of Golgi and other membranes has been already established [Traffic 1 (2000) 504] essentially in their role in the production of second messenger molecules. In this work we illustrate with raft-containing giant lipid vesicles a mechanism for raft-vesicle expulsion from the membrane clue to the activity of a single enzyme-phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). This leads to the hypothesis that the PLA(2), apart from its role in second messenger generation, might play a direct and general role 
in the vesiculation processes underlying the intermembrane transport of rafts through purely physicochemical mechanisms. These mechanisms would be: enzyme adsorption leading to membrane curvature generation (budding), and enzyme activity modulation of the line tension at the raft boundaries, which induces vesicle fission.

Giant polymersomes of several tens of microns in diameter can be prepared from low T-g (glass transition temperature) flexible (coil-coil) copolymers by processes such as rehydration swelling or electroformation. These techniques are, however, inefficient in producing giant polymersomes composed of high T-g and/or rigid-flexible (rod-coil) copolymers. We have used an alternative method based on the formation of an inverted emulsion to produce giant unilamellar rod-coil polymersomes. We have selected copolymers whose hydrophobic moieties are glassy liquid crystalline polymers. The viscoelasticity of individual polymersomes has been measured by micropipette aspiration. Whereas the elastic modulus was found to be of the same order of magnitude as the one of prototypical vesicles made of coil-coil copolymers, the membrane viscosity of this new class of polymersomes was about three orders of magnitude more viscous than their coil-coil 
counterparts. The versatile method used here to form giant polymersomes could be useful for designing and studying novel functional polymer capsules. The results highlight the possibility of widely tuning the mechanical properties of polymersomes by selecting or synthesizing the proper copolymer.},

We have reconstituted this transport process in vitro using Xenopus egg cytosol and a rat liver Golgi-enriched membrane fraction. The presence of BFA results in the formation of an intricate, interconnected tubular membrane network, a process that, as in vivo, is inhibited by nocodazole, the H1 anti-kinesin monoclonal antibody, and by membrane pretreatment with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Surprisingly, membrane tubule formation is not due to the action of conventional kinesin or any of the other motors implicated in Golgi membrane dynamics. Two candidate motors of similar to 100 and similar to 130 kDa have been identified using the H1 antibody, both of which exhibit motor properties in a biochemical assay. Finally, BFA-induced membrane tubule formation does not occur in metaphase 
cytosol, and because membrane binding of both candidate motors is not altered after incubation in metaphase compared with interphase cytosol, these results suggest that either the ATPase or microtubule-binding activity of the relevant motor is cell cycle regulated.},

In this paper, we discuss both theoretically and experimentally the dynamical laws that govern extrusion and retraction of tubes extracted from lipid vesicles at high speed and under strong flows. A detailed description of the tether shape provides the first evidence that the tension along the tube increases from the vesicle body to the tip of the tube, while the tube radius decreases. As the pulling force is suppressed suddenly, the tube can relax only from the free end, and the velocity of retraction is a direct measurement of the frozen tension along the tube. We also report experiments on tethers pulled out either by mechanical point-forces or by hydrodynamic (electroosmosis-induced) flow, and we show that the observed dynamical laws for retraction are in good quantitative agreement with our theoretical predictions.},

	Abstract = {During maturation of the red blood cell (RBC) from the nucleated normoblast stage to the mature biconcave discocyte, both the structure and mechanical properties of the cell undergo radical changes. The development of the mechanical stability of the membrane reflects underlying changes in the organization of membrane-associated cytoskeletal proteins, and so provides an assessment of the time course of the development of membrane structural organization. Membrane stability in maturing erythrocytes was assessed by measuring forces required to form thin, tubular, lipid strands (tethers) from the surfaces of mononuclear cells obtained from fresh human marrow samples, marrow reticulocytes, circulating reticulocytes, and mature erythrocytes. Cells were biotinylated and manipulated with a micropipette to form an adhesive contact with a glass microcantilever, which gave a measure of the tethering force. The cell was withdrawn at controlled velocity and aspiration pressure to form a tether from the cell 
surface, The mean force required to form tethers from marrow reticulocytes and normoblasts was 27 +/- 9 pN, compared to 54 +/- 14 pN for mature cells, The energy of dissociation of the bilayer from the underlying skeleton increases 4-fold between the marrow reticulocyte stage and the mature cell, demonstrating that the mechanical stability of the membrane is not completely established until the very last stages of RBC maturation.

	Abstract = {Membrane tension has been proposed to be important in regulating cell functions such as endocytosis and cell motility. The apparent membrane tension has been calculated from tether forces measured with laser tweezers. Both membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion and membrane tension contribute to the tether force. Separation of the plasma membrane from the cytoskeleton occurs in membrane blebs, which could remove the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion term. In renal epithelial cells, tether forces are significantly lower on blebs than on membranes that are supported by cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the tether forces are equal on apical and basolateral blebs. In contrast, tether forces from membranes supported by the cytoskeleton are greater in apical than in basolateral regions, which is consistent with the greater apparent cytoskeletal density in the apical region. We suggest that the tether force on blebs primarily contains only the membrane tension term and that the membrane tension may be uniform over the 
cell surface. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from observations of melanoma cells that spontaneously bleb. In melanoma cells, tether forces on blebs are proportional to the radius of the bleb, and as large blebs form, there are spikes in the tether force in other cell regions. We suggest that an internal osmotic pressure inflates the blebs, and the pressure calculated from the Law of Laplace is similar to independent measurements of intracellular pressures. When the membrane tension term is subtracted from the apparent membrane tension over the cytoskeleton, the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion term can be estimated. In both cell systems, membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion was the major factor in generating the tether force.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method for the evolution of inextensible vesicles immersed in a Stokesian fluid. We use a boundary integral formulation for the fluid that results in a set of nonlinear integro-differential equations for the vesicle dynamics. The motion of the vesicles is determined by balancing the non-local hydrodynamic forces with the elastic forces due to bending and tension. Numerical simulations of such vesicle motions are quite challenging. On one hand, explicit time-stepping schemes suffer from a severe stability constraint due to the stiffness related to high-order spatial derivatives and a milder constraint due to a transport-like stability condition. On the other hand, an implicit scheme can be expensive because it requires the solution of a set of nonlinear equations at each time step. We present two semi-implicit schemes that circumvent the severe stability constraints on the time step and whose computational cost per time step is comparable to that of an explicit scheme. We 
discretize the equations by using a spectral method in space, and a multistep third-order accurate scheme in time. We use the fast multipole method (FMM) to efficiently compute vesicle-vesicle interaction forces in a suspension with a large ORIGINALnumber of vesicles. We report results from numerical experiments that demonstrate the convergence and algorithmic complexity properties of our scheme. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lipowsky2011,
	Abstract = {Tubular membrane structures are widespread in eukaryotic cells, but the mechanisms underlying their formation and stability are not well understood. Previous work has focused on tube extrusion from cells and model membranes under the application of external forces. Here, we present novel membrane/polymer systems, where stable tubes form in the absence of externally applied forces. Solutions of two water-soluble polymers, polyethylene glycol and dextran, were encapsulated in giant lipid vesicles, cell-size model systems. Hypertonic deflation induced phase separation of the enclosed solution. The excess membrane area created during the deflation process was stored in a large ORIGINALnumber of membrane nanotubes inside the vesicle. The tubes had a diameter below optical resolution and became visible only when fluorescently labeled. The tubes were rather stable: In the absence of external forces, they existed for several days. A theoretical analysis of the shapes of the deflated vesicles reveals 
that these shapes would be unstable if the membranes had no spontaneous curvature. Using the large separation of length scales between the tube diameter and the overall size of the vesicles, the spontaneous curvature can be calculated and is found to be about -1/(240 nm) for a certain range of polymer concentrations. The nanotubes could also be retracted back into the mother vesicle by increasing the membrane tension via micropipette aspiration of the vesicle. Membrane tubes, which can form and be retracted easily, should be relevant for lipid storage in cells.},

	Abstract = {Membrane remodelling(1-5) plays an important role in cellular tasks such as endocytosis, vesiculation and protein sorting, and in the biogenesis of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus. It is well established that the remodelling process is aided by specialized proteins that can sense(4) as well as create(6) membrane curvature, and trigger tubulation(7-9) when added to synthetic liposomes. Because the energy needed for such large-scale changes in membrane geometry significantly exceeds the binding energy between individual proteins and between protein and membrane, cooperative action is essential. It has recently been suggested(10,11) that curvature-mediated attractive interactions could aid cooperation and complement the effects of specific binding events on membrane remodelling. But it is difficult to experimentally isolate curvature-mediated interactions from direct attractions between proteins. Moreover, approximate theories predict repulsion between 
isotropically curving proteins(12-15). Here we use coarse-grained membrane simulations to show that curvature-inducing model proteins adsorbed on lipid bilayer membranes can experience attractive interactions that arise purely as a result of membrane curvature. We find that once a minimal local bending is realized, the effect robustly drives protein cluster formation and subsequent transformation into vesicles with radii that correlate with the local curvature imprint. Owing to its universal nature, curvature-mediated attraction can operate even between proteins lacking any specific interactions, such as newly synthesized and still immature membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.},

	Abstract = {Cells are wrapped in inelastic membranes, yet they can sustain large mechanical strains by regulating their area. The area regulation in cells is achieved either by membrane folding or by membrane exo- and endocytosis. These processes involve complex morphological transformations of the cell membrane, i.e., invagination, vesicle fusion, and fission, whose precise mechanisms are still under debate. Here we provide mechanistic insights into the area regulation of cell membranes, based on the previously neglected role of membrane confinement, as well as on the strain-induced membrane tension. Commonly, the membranes of mammalian and plant cells are not isolated, but rather they are adhered to an extracellular matrix, the cytoskeleton, and to other cell membranes. Using a lipid bilayer, coupled to an elastic sheet, we are able to demonstrate that, upon straining, the confined membrane is able to regulate passively its area. In particular, by stretching the elastic support, the bilayer laterally 
expands without rupture by fusing adhered lipid vesicles; upon compression, lipid tubes grow out of the membrane plane, thus reducing its area. These transformations are reversible, as we show using cycles of expansion and compression, and closely reproduce membrane processes found in cells during area regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate a new mechanism for the formation of lipid tubes in cells, which is driven by the membrane lateral compression and may therefore explain the various membrane tubules observed in shrinking cells.},

We find four periods in the life of a transient pore: (I) exponential growth of the young pore; (II) stop of the growth at a maximum radius ih,; (III) slow closure limited by the leak-out; (IV) fast closure below a critical radius, when leak-out becomes negligible.

@article{Mathai2008,
	Abstract = {Despite intense study over many years, the mechanisms by which water and small nonelectrolytes cross lipid bilayers remain unclear. While prior studies of permeability through membranes have focused on solute characteristics, such as size, polarity, and partition coefficient in hydrophobic solvent, we focus here on water permeability in seven single component bilayers composed of different lipids, five with phosphatidylcholine headgroups and different chain lengths and unsaturation, one with a phosphatidylserine headgroup, and one with a phosphatidylethanolamine headgroup. We find that water permeability correlates most strongly with the area/lipid and is poorly correlated with bilayer thickness and other previously determined structural and mechanical properties of these single component bilayers. These results suggest a new model for permeability that is developed in the accompanying theoretical paper in which the area occupied by the lipid is the major determinant and the hydrocarbon 
thickness is a secondary determinant. Cholesterol was also incorporated into DOPC bilayers and X-ray diffuse scattering was used to determine quantitative structure with the result that the area occupied by DOPC in the membrane decreases while bilayer thickness increases in a correlated way because lipid volume does not change. The water permeability decreases with added cholesterol and it correlates in a different way from pure lipids with area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and also with area compressibility.},

We show that for small but finite line and surface tensions and for finite spontaneous curvatures, an equilibrium phase of protruding circular domains is obtained at low impurity concentrations. At higher concentrations, we predict a transition from circular domains, or caplets, to stripes. In both cases, we calculate the shapes of these domains within the Monge representation for the membrane shape. With increasing line tension, we show numerically that there is a budding transformation from stable protruding circular domains to spherical buds. We calculate the full phase diagram and demonstrate two triple points of, respectively, bud-flat-caplet and flat-stripe-caplet coexistence.},

Our result constitutes the first direct measurement of the shear surface viscosity of such polymersomes. At the same time, we measure bending and stretching elastic constants, which fall in the range of values typical for lipid membranes. Pulling out a tether from an immobilized polymersome and following its relaxation back to the vesicle body provides an estimate of the viscous coupling between the two monolayers composing the polymer membrane. The detected intermonolayer friction is about an order of magnitude higher than the characteristic one for phospholipid membranes. Polymersomes are tough vesicles with a high lysis tension. This, together with their robust rheological properties, makes them interesting candidates for a ORIGINALnumber of technological applications.},

	Abstract = {Membrane tethers are extracted at constant velocity from neuronal growth cones using a force generated by a laser tweezers trap. A thermodynamic analysis shows that as the tether is extended, energy is stored in the tether as bending and adhesion energies and in the cell body as ''nonlocal'' bending. It is postulated that energy is dissipated by three viscous mechanisms including membrane flow, slip between the two monolayers that form the bilayer, and slip between membrane and cytoskeleton. The analysis predicts and the experiments show a linear relation between tether force and tether velocity. Calculations based on the analytical results and the experimental measurements of a tether radius of similar to 0.2 mu m and a tether force at zero velocity of similar to 8 pN give a bending modulus for the tether of 2.7 x 10(-19) N . m and an extraordinarily small ''apparent surface tension'' in the growth cone of 0.003 mN/m, where the apparent surface tension is the sum of the far-field, in-plane 
tension and the energy of adhesion. Treatments with cytochalasin B and D, ethanol, and nocodazole affect the apparent surface tension but not bending. ATP depletion affects neither, whereas large concentrations of DMSO affect both. Under conditions of flow, data are presented to show that the dominant viscous mechanism comes from the slip that occurs when the membrane flows over the cytoskeleton. ATP depletion and the treatment with DMSO cause a dramatic drop in the effective viscosity. If it is postulated that the slip between membrane and cytoskeleton occurs in a film of water, then this water film has a mean thickness of only similar to 10 Angstrom.},

This demonstrates that intermonolayer friction is an important phenomenon for the relaxation processes of fluctuating bilayers. We further discuss our data in the light of two existing theoretical approaches describing the dynamics of quasi-spherical fluctuating vesicles. However, our results do not permit to favor one approach over the other. Nonetheless, from our data we estimate the intermonolayer friction coefficient for SOPC bilayers to be within the interval 5 x 10(8) Ns /m(3) and 5 x 10(9) Ns/m(3), which is somewhat larger than previously published values using a different technique.},

Optical tweezers were used to characterize the mechanical properties of the outer hair cell (OHC) plasma membrane by pulling tethers with 4.5-[mu]m polystyrene beads. Tether formation force and tether force were measured in static and dynamic conditions. A greater force was required for tether formations from OHC lateral wall (499 $\pm$ 152 pN) than from OHC basal end (142 $\pm$ 49 pN). The difference in the force required to pull tethers is consistent with an extensive cytoskeletal framework associated with the lateral wall known as the cortical lattice. The apparent plasma membrane stiffness, estimated under the static conditions by measuring tether force at different tether length, was 3.71 pN/[mu]m for OHC lateral wall and 4.57 pN/[mu]m for OHC basal end. The effective membrane viscosity was measured by pulling tethers at different rates while continuously recording the tether force, and estimated in the range of 2.39 to 5.25 pN·s/[mu]m. The viscous force most likely results from the viscous interactions 
between plasma membrane lipids and the OHC cortical lattice and/or integral membrane proteins. The information these studies provide on the mechanical properties of the OHC lateral wall is important for understanding the mechanism of OHC electromotility.},

Giant unilamellar vesicles with diameters ranging from 10 to 60 microns were obtained by the swelling of phospholipid bilayers in water in the presence of an AC electric field. This technique leads to a homogeneous population of perfectly spherical and unilamellar vesicles, as revealed by phase-contrast optical microscopy and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Freshly prepared vesicles had a high surface tension with no visible surface undulations. Undulations started spontaneously after several hours of incubation or were triggered by the application of a small osmotic pressure. Partially deflated giant vesicles could undergo further shape change if asymmetrical bilayers were formed by adding lyso compounds to the external leaflet or by imposing a transmembrane pH gradient that selectively accumulates on one leaflet phosphatidylglycerol. Fluorescence photobleaching with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-labeled phospholipids or labeled dextran trapped within the vesicles enabled the measurement of the 
membrane continuity in the dumbbell-shaped vesicles. In all instances phospholipids diffused from one lobe to the other, but soluble dextran sometimes was unable to traverse the neck. This suggests that the diameter of the connecting neck may be variable.},

   Mitochondria play a key role as well in the cell death and in various

   mitochondria present an astonishing variety of inner membrane
   morphologies, dynamically correlated with their functional state,
   coupled with the rate of the ATP synthesis, and characteristic for

   remodeling of an only-lipid membrane. We designed a minimal membrane
   system (GUV) and experimentally showed that the directional modulation
   of local pH gradient at membrane level of cardiolipin-containing
   vesicles induces dynamic cristae-like membrane invaginations. We propose
   a mechanism and theoretical model to explain the observed tubular

The ER may be shaped by several mechanisms. ER tubules are often generated through their association with the cytoskeleton and stabilized by two families of integral membrane proteins, the reticulons and DPI /Yop1p. Similar to how curvature is generated in budding vesicles, these proteins may use scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms to shape the lipid bilayer into tubules. In addition, proteins of the dynamin family may deform the ER membrane to generate a tubular network. Mechanisms affecting local membrane curvature may also shape peripheral ER sheets and the nuclear envelope as well as 
mitochondria and caveolae.},

	Abstract = {Brownian motion (diffusion) of particles in membranes occurs in a highly anisotropic environment. For such particles a translational mobility (independent of velocity) can be defined if the viscosity of the liquid embedding the membrane is taken into account. The results of a model calculation are presented. They suggest that for a realistic situation translational diffusion should be about four times faster in relation to rotational diffusion than in the isotropic case.},
